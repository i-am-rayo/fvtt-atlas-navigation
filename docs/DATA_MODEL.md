# Proposed data model — v0.1

**Status:** schema v1 is now implemented for Phase 2a (atlas setup/calibration only). Road editing is deferred; validators already enforce node/segment integrity. This example illustrates the persisted contract.

## 1. Storage boundary

An atlas belongs to one Foundry `Scene`. The module would read and write:

- Module namespace: `fvtt-atlas-navigation`
- Flag key: `atlas`
- API pattern (subject to v14 smoke test): `scene.getFlag("fvtt-atlas-navigation", "atlas")` / `scene.setFlag("fvtt-atlas-navigation", "atlas", value)`
- Full conceptual path: `flags.fvtt-atlas-navigation.atlas`

Keep authored roads in this single versioned payload initially; **do not** scatter the same source of truth across Drawings, Token documents, world settings, or duplicated client caches.

The canonical network is always the **validated persisted model**, never the graphics, the computed route, or a temporary cursor state.

## 2. Proposed version 1 JSON

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "revision": 1,
  "enabled": true,
  "calibration": {
    "source": "manual",
    "unitsPerPixel": 0.05,
    "unit": "mi"
  },
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "junction-a", "x": 100, "y": 100 },
    { "id": "junction-b", "x": 500, "y": 100 },
    { "id": "junction-c", "x": 500, "y": 400 }
  ],
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": "road-ab",
      "from": "junction-a",
      "to": "junction-b",
      "via": [{ "x": 300, "y": 80 }],
      "name": "Western Road",
      "bidirectional": true
    },
    {
      "id": "road-bc",
      "from": "junction-b",
      "to": "junction-c",
      "via": [],
      "name": "Southern Track",
      "bidirectional": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This is one connected three-junction graph. Its `via` coordinates are **interior** polyline points, not duplicated endpoints. The displayed distance of `road-ab` is approximately 20.10 mi, and `road-bc` is 15.00 mi, under the illustrative calibration.

### Field contract

| Field | Type | Meaning / constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | positive integer | Persisted schema for forward migration; initially `1` |
| `revision` | nonnegative integer | Detects stale dialogs; not an atomic transactional lock |
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether this Scene is currently marked as an atlas; disabling preserves road data |
| `calibration.source` | string | `manual` initially; later `scene-grid` if confirmed appropriate |
| `calibration.unitsPerPixel` | positive finite number | Travel units per one Scene pixel; required before real-unit distance is shown |
| `calibration.unit` | short string | Unit code for display, e.g. `mi` or `km`; never assume every world uses miles |
| `nodes[]` | array | Authored junctions with unique stable IDs and finite pixel coordinates |
| `segments[]` | array | Authored road segments with unique stable IDs and valid endpoint IDs |
| `segments[].via` | ordered array | Interior Scene-space polyline points, from `from` toward `to` |
| `segments[].bidirectional` | boolean | `true` in v1; reserve directed edges for a later explicit feature |
| `segments[].name` | string | Optional GM road label, never an identifier |

If calibration is unknown, store `calibration: null` and do not invent miles/km. A new unconfigured Scene has no `atlas` flag and reads as `{schemaVersion: 1, revision: 0, enabled: false, calibration: null, nodes: [], segments: []}` without writing. Only an explicit GM save persists the flag.

## 3. Coordinates and topology

- Coordinates are stored in **Scene/image pixels** and remain invariant when the viewer zooms, pans, or resizes.
- Pixel-to-unit conversion is specific to the Scene. A calibrated route's distance is the sum of its segment polyline lengths times `unitsPerPixel`.
- Nodes are topological junctions. Only equal **node IDs** connect roads; matching x/y pixels or visually crossing polylines alone do not connect them.
- Every `from`/`to` must reference a currently existing node; a segment cannot connect a node to itself in v1.
- Duplicate node or segment IDs, nonfinite coordinates, negative/zero calibration, and degenerate zero-length geometry are invalid.
- Editing node coordinates updates every attached segment geometrically, because endpoints are read from node references.
- Deleting a connected node requires an explicit UX policy (prevent deletion, or confirm cascaded segment deletion). Never leave dangling references.
- If the user later wants bridges and roads to cross without intersecting, explicit IDs already represent that distinction.

The example uses hand-readable IDs. Actual IDs should be generated uniquely and remain stable under edits, saves, exports, and imports.

## 4. Derived graph, not stored twice

The routing engine builds an in-memory adjacency list from validated nodes/segments.

For each segment:

1. Form a polyline: `node[from]` → each `via` point → `node[to]`.
2. Calculate a positive finite geometric length.
3. Add an edge from `from` to `to` with that weight.
4. For a bidirectional segment, add the reverse edge with reverse traversal geometry.
5. Use Dijkstra for the shortest-distance query; apply deterministic tie-breaking for equal-distance candidates.

A future optimizer may add a spatial index or cached graph keyed to the data revision, but the adjacency list and shortest path are **derived**. They do not need a second permanent flag.

### Temporary query and result shapes

These are in-memory interface examples, **not** Scene flags:

```ts
type RouteQuery = {
  sceneId: string;
  startNodeId: string;
  endNodeId: string;
};

type RouteResult = {
  sceneId: string;
  nodeIds: string[];
  segmentIds: string[];
  distancePixels: number;
  distanceUnits: number | null; // null when calibration is absent
  path: Array<{ x: number; y: number }>; // ordered Scene coordinates
};
```

For a disconnected graph, return an explicit typed "unreachable" outcome; do not return a straight line or silently fall back to Euclidean distance between endpoints.

## 5. Places, Notes, and linked lore

Do **not** copy journal text, permissions, or full pin records into `atlas`. Foundry `NoteDocument` already supports placed notes linked to `JournalEntry` / `JournalEntryPage`; use IDs/UUIDs only if an explicit connection to a graph junction is needed.

Potential later extension:

- A Note/POI can be route-selectable by snapping its Scene position to a segment with an explicit tolerance.
- The snap creates **temporary** virtual graph nodes for the query.
- If a stable POI-to-junction association is needed, model it as a separately versioned, optional reference, validating stale links without deleting the user's original Note.
- Native Note and Journal permissions remain authoritative for lore visibility.

Do not introduce arbitrary namespaced flag metadata on Note/Journal documents unless a real use case demands it.

## 6. Persistence and migrations

- Always validate and normalize on read, without mutating the Scene as a side effect of viewing it.
- Only an authorized GM action may persist changes.
- Before writing, validate the entire replacement payload, increment the revision, and re-read if necessary.
- A `revision` field alone **does not** provide atomic compare-and-swap; implement collision handling or explicitly support only one simultaneous editor in the first release.
- Keep JSON compatible (no `Map`/`Set`, class instances, `undefined`, cyclic objects, or executable values).
- On a future breaking change, add a pure migration `v1 → v2`, make backups/import-export practical, and never silently discard unknown saved content.
- For import, validate the schema and bounded array sizes before allowing an explicit user-approved replacement. An import operation must not execute or trust embedded script/HTML.
- Consider payload size and update frequency as the network grows; if these become limiting, decide on a more granular authorized storage model, with a migration plan.

## 7. Privacy boundary

A flag on a Scene is not automatically protected just because only the GM sees the UI rendering it. In v1 all road-network authoring and navigation is **GM-only**, and the saved model must not be assumed confidential if a player has access to the Scene.

Do not add `isHidden` and interpret that as secure storage. A future player/reveal schema needs an actual transport/access design, verified with two clients, before launch.

## 8. Deferred data extensions

- Travel modes, per-segment speeds, terrain difficulty, road classes, and closures.
- One-way segments and multi-modal route weights.
- Named saved itineraries separate from canonical roads.
- Cross-Scene atlas transitions and multi-Scene route IDs.
- Per-user explored/revealed layers and filtered route projections.
- Versioned export/import package format.

None of these should be added to the v1 JSON merely to anticipate an undefined feature.
